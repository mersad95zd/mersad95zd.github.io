I am a third-year _Machine Learning_ Ph.D. student in the Department of _Electrical and Computer Engineering_ at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC), advised by and Prof. [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in 2019 from UIUC with double majors in (1) Statistics & Computer Science, (2) Physics. 

My current research interest is *machine learning with distribution shifts*, including domain adaptation, domain generalization, and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. I am trying to provide a deeper (theoretical) understanding of them while developing applicable algorithms. Previously, I have worked on meta-learning and multi-task learning.
