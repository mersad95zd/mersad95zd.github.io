I'm an AI Research Scientist at Ground Truth Analytics (GTA) working on deep learning based satellite imagery for agricultural applications.
I recently graduated from [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) _ECE department_. There, I worked in the _Machine Learning and Information processing Laboratory (MLI Lab)_ and was very lucky to be advised by [Reinhard Heckel](http://reinhardheckel.com/). 
Before that, I did my undergrad in _EE_ at [Sharif University of Technology](http://ee.sharif.edu/~web/en/).
  
I'm highly passionate about _AI for Good_. In particular, I enjoy studying the performance and reliability of _Deep Learning_ models in computer vision applications such as image classification and image reconstruction.
